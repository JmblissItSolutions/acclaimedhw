It is a yearly service contract that ensures the company you purchase from will send a partner contractor to complete the work and pay for the repairs. A home warranty provides added peace of mind, especially if the items covered in your warranty are older and no longer have valid manufacturers’ warranties.

Unfortunately, appliances and home systems don’t break down on a schedule and can happen at any time. If you aren’t prepared, you’re left to cover the costs of repair or replacement on your own. However, with a home warranty plan, you won’t have to worry about these unexpected expenses, as our coverage will take care of it. It’s an excellent way to save money and stop the constant worry of covering these costs alone. Our plans give you the option to choose what you include, but the most common household systems covered in home warranty plans include:</p>\r\n                                    <li>Heating system or furnace</li>\r\n                                    <li>Washer and dryer</li>\r\n                                    <li>Plumbing systems</li>\r\n                                    <li>Refrigerator</li>\r\n                                    <li>Garage door systems</li>\r\n                                    <li>Air conditioners</li> \r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>How Does a Home Warranty Save Me Money?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>Owning a home comes with a lot of expenses. You’re responsible for your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, and more. On top of that, you have to pay to maintain its condition and you may even want to upgrade some items. With all these expenses, how are you supposed to also find money to repair or replace household items if they break? A home warranty can save you the cost of these repairs and replacements. In exchange for an annual fee, your home warranty coverage will cover the cost of replacements or repairs to your most important appliances and systems. In the long run, paying for a home warranty is much more cost effective than paying out of pocket for repairs or replacements, as those can quickly tally hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>Choosing a Home Warranty</h3>\r\n                                    <p>If you’re thinking that a home warranty sounds pretty similar to homeowner’s insurance, you aren’t alone. These two types of plans do work in a similar way to protect your home and the items within it, however there is a difference. Your home insurance policy covers unexpected damage to the structure and contents of your home due to unforeseen events like fires, storms, or natural disasters, and may also cover theft of your personal property. Unfortunately, homeowner’s insurance does not cover everyday breakdowns of your systems or appliances, and that’s where home warranty comes in handy. A home warranty plan will cover most breakdowns of primary mechanical systems and appliances at your home, making it an excellent counterpart to home insurance.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>What’s NOT Covered by a Home Warranty?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>As previously mentioned, a home warranty covers the cost of repairs or replacements for items that have broken down due to normal wear and tear during the contract period. This means that any appliance or home system that breaks down because of improper use or inadequate care will not be covered by the warranty. The same goes for items that were malfunctioning prior to the effective state date of the contract. In addition, any non-mechanical parts of the system or appliance that don’t contribute to its primary function will not be covered by the plan.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>How Long Does My Contract Last?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>In most cases, a home warranty contract will last for one year.
