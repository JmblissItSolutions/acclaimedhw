It is a yearly service contract that ensures the company you purchase from will send a partner contractor to complete the work and pay for the repairs. A home warranty provides added peace of mind, especially if the items covered in your warranty are older and no longer have valid manufacturers’ warranties. Though the coverage may sound similar to insurance, a home warranty is actually a separate product. </p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>Why Purchase a Home Warranty?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>A home warranty is an excellent way to ensure your home has maximum protection against unforeseen breakdowns and repairs. Unfortunately, appliances and home systems don’t break down on a schedule and can happen at any time. If you aren’t prepared, you’re left to cover the costs of repair or replacement on your own. However, with a home warranty plan, you won’t have to worry about these unexpected expenses, as our coverage will take care of it. It’s an excellent way to save money and stop the constant worry of covering these costs alone. Our plans give you the option to choose what you include, but the most common household systems covered in home warranty plans include:</p>\r\n                                    <li>Heating system or furnace</li>\r\n                                    <li>Washer and dryer</li>\r\n                                    <li>Plumbing systems</li>\r\n                                    <li>Refrigerator</li>\r\n                                    <li>Garage door systems</li>\r\n                                    <li>Air conditioners</li> \r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>How Does a Home Warranty Save Me Money?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>Owning a home comes with a lot of expenses. You’re responsible for your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, and more. On top of that, you have to pay to maintain its condition and you may even want to upgrade some items. With all these expenses, how are you supposed to also find money to repair or replace household items if they break? A home warranty can save you the cost of these repairs and replacements. In exchange for an annual fee, your home warranty coverage will cover the cost of replacements or repairs to your most important appliances and systems. In the long run, paying for a home warranty is much more cost effective than paying out of pocket for repairs or replacements, as those can quickly tally hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>Choosing a Home Warranty</h3>\r\n                                    <p>There are home warranty options to suit every need, even the needs of homeowners currently looking to sell their property.
