This coverage essentially pays for the repairs and replacements of the covered items when they break down due to normal wear and tear. The purchaser of the plan pays an annual fee for the warranty coverage and signs the service contract. Then, when you encounter a system breakdown, the warranty company pays for the repairs or replacement, provided the malfunctioning system is covered under your contract. Many warranty companies allow you to choose which appliances and systems are covered in your plan before agreeing to the contract.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>What Does a Home Warranty Cover?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>Your home warranty plan can cover a range of home appliances and systems.

These two types of plans do work in a similar way to protect your home and the items within it, however there is a difference. Your home insurance policy covers unexpected damage to the structure and contents of your home due to unforeseen events like fires, storms, or natural disasters, and may also cover theft of your personal property. Unfortunately, homeowner’s insurance does not cover everyday breakdowns of your systems or appliances, and that’s where home warranty comes in handy. A home warranty plan will cover most breakdowns of primary mechanical systems and appliances at your home, making it an excellent counterpart to home insurance.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>What’s NOT Covered by a Home Warranty?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>As previously mentioned, a home warranty covers the cost of repairs or replacements for items that have broken down due to normal wear and tear during the contract period. This means that any appliance or home system that breaks down because of improper use or inadequate care will not be covered by the warranty. The same goes for items that were malfunctioning prior to the effective state date of the contract. In addition, any non-mechanical parts of the system or appliance that don’t contribute to its primary function will not be covered by the plan.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                            <div className=\"home_wranty\">\r\n                                <div className=\"inner_homewranty\">\r\n                                    <h3>How Long Does My Contract Last?</h3>\r\n                                    <p>In most cases, a home warranty contract will last for one year. As the end of your contract approaches, you’ll have the opportunity to sign a new contract that will last for an additional year. If you choose not to sign a new agreement, your coverage will lapse on the specified date, which will terminate all member advantages and end the protection coverage on your home.</p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div> \r\n                        </div>\r\n                  </div> \r\n             </div>\r\n              <div className=\"contact_us\">\r\n                <h3>Contact Us Today with Additional Questions</h3>\r\n                <p>If you have additional questions about our home warranty options for buyers, sellers, or real estate agents, please reach out to Acclaimed Home Warranty today.
